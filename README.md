## Dog Breed Classification
Trained 120 dog breed classifier with 10k training images. Achieved 90% validation accuracuy. Performed transfer learning from imagenet dataset, which already has a number of these classes within it. Files include a standard python package for training and testing model, as well as a jupyter notebook file for a step-by-step walkthrough. My weights can be downloaded here: [Dog Breed Weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hqm0nwG04Bm2fL8gOOutxZ9wDSTQsYI_/view?usp=sharing).

## Airbus Ship Detection
Unfinished at time of writing this. Task is a single-class detection problem for ships at sea from satellite images. Can experiment with a single shot detector (SSD) (i.e. YOLO), or can create a UNet for binary segmentation of ship/ water and build bounding boxes around result.
